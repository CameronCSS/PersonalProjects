## Introduction

During my search for data on <a href="https://github.com/CameronCSS/PersonalProjects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/SLC%20Homless%20Data" target="new">homelessness in Salt Lake City</a>, I found that SLC has a website and app where residents can report complaints to the city.


- <a href="https://opendata.utah.gov/"> Website </a>
- <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slc-mobile/id790019118"> Apple App </a>
- <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citysourced.saltlakecityut&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1"> Android App </a>

**This data was relevant to me because it had a massive amount of people complaining about "Homelessness" and even people uploading pictures to the app for the city to review.**

----
**Being a State government agency they are making the data open and available through an API, so I began pouring through the data and found some interesting numbers.**

### Insights

- Apple users register the most of amount of complaints regarding homlessness, parking problems, Graffiti, Illegaly dumping trash, and almost every single category
- Apple devices are responsible for a larger number of complaints compared to other device types. This could be due to a higher market share of Apple devices, or it could indicate that Apple users are more likely to report issues.
- A much larger percentage of Apple complaints included a picture when compared with the complaints from Android or on the Website.
- The app also tracks when a complaint is "closed". It took the city an Average of 48 days to resolve and close complaints.

**Based on the data available I am unable to determine if "closed" means the complaint was fixed, or if they are just acknowledging the complaint.*


## Visualization

### As you can see, Apple users are submitting a majority of the complaints.

**Complaints were collected between July 2014, and July 2022*


According to eMarketer, Android phones make up 53% of total smartphone users.
When we compare that to the amount of complaints the numbers seem even more skewed in Apples direction.

- Homlessness, Parking, and Graffiti are the top 3 most registered complaints.
- There were over 150 Unique complaints registered in the app, most of which were useless things the city could ignore.
- The graph makes it very apparent Apple users register a majority of the complaints in SLC
