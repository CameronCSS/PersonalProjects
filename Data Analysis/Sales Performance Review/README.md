As part of our ongoing efforts to track and improve the performance of our business, I have created a dashboard using Microsoft Excel and Power BI to visualize and analyze our sales data over the past 4 years. 
The dashboard includes a comparison of sales across multiple locations, allowing us to see how each location is performing over time and in relation to the others.

Overall, this dashboard provides a valuable overview of our sales performance over the past 4 years, and will be a useful tool as we continue to monitor and optimize our business going forward.
